# Scan for CVE-2017-0143 MS17-010
# The vulnerability used by WannaCry Ransomware
# 
# 1. Use @calderpwn's script
#    http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2017/q2/79
# 
# 2. Save it to Nmap NSE script directory
#    Linux - /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ or /usr/local/share/nmap/scripts/
#    OSX - /opt/local/share/nmap/scripts/
# 
# Note: 
# I had to use "--max-hostgroup 3", otherwise the script misses vulnerable hosts using nmap 7.30 on OS X
# Don't use "-T4", this also caused the script to miss vulnerable hosts
#
